        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The <cite>Geolocation API</cite> defines a high-level interface to
        location information associated only with the device hosting the
        implementation, such as latitude and longitude. Common sources of
        location information include Global Positioning System (GPS) and
        location inferred from network signals such as IP address, RFID, WiFi
        and Bluetooth MAC addresses, and GSM/CDMA cell IDs, as well as user
        input. The API itself is agnostic of the underlying location
        information sources, and no guarantee is given that the API returns the
        device's actual location.
      </p>
      <p>
        For developers, the Geolocation API:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Provides location data in terms of a pair of latitude and longitude
        coordinates, and given an indication of the accuracy of the retrieved
        location data.
        </li>
        <li>Supports "one-shot" position updates.
        </li>
        <li>Allows an application to register to receive updates when the
        position of the hosting device changes.
        </li>
        <li>Allows an application to request a cached position whose age is no
        greater than a specified value.
        </li>
        <li>Provides a way for the application to receive updates about errors
        that have occurred while obtaining a location fix.
        </li>
        <li>Allows an application to specify a desired accuracy level of the
        location information.
        </li>
      </ul>

          Scope
        </h3>
        <p>
          This specification is limited to providing a scripting API for
          retrieving geographic position information associated with a hosting
          device. The geographic position information is provided in terms of
          World Geodetic System coordinates [[WGS84]]. It does not include
          providing a markup language of any kind, nor does not include
          defining a new URL scheme for building URLs that identify geographic
          locations.

          Changes since last publication
        </h2>
        <p>
          Since publication of the Second Edition in 2016, this specification
          has undergone the following changes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Geolocation updates only occur when a document is visible, or the
          document becomes visible.
          </li>
          <li>Depend on the [[[Permissions]]] specification to handle
          permission grants.
          </li>
          <li>The `errorCallback` can now be set to `null`.
          </li>
          <li>The API can be controlled by [[[Permissions-Policy]]], which
          restricts how/where the API is exposed to web pages.
          </li>
          <li>The `callbacks` are no longer treated as "EventHandler" objects
          (i.e., objects that have a `.handleEvent()` method), but are now
          always treated as proper callback functions in JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>The API is now only exposed in Secure Contexts (i.e., only
          available in HTTPS).
          </li>
          <li>The interfaces no longer use [[WebIDL]]'s legacy
          `[NoInterfaceObject]`, so `Geolocation` and other interface of this
          spec are now in the global scope. Also, the interfaces were renamed
          from `NavigatorGeolocation*` to just `Geolocation*`.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>
        Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        The API is designed to enable both "one-shot" position requests and
        repeated position updates, as well as the ability to explicitly query
        the cached positions. Location information is represented by latitude
        and longitude coordinates.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following examples illustrate how the API can be used in various
        common scenarios.

          Privacy considerations for recipients of location information
        </h3>
        <p class="note" title=
        "Developers' responsibility with this sensitive data">
          This section applies to "recipients", which generally means
          developers utilizing the <cite>Geolocation API</cite>. Although it's
          impossible for user agent, or this specification, to enforce these
          requirements, developers need to read this section carefully and do
          their best to adhere to the recommendations below. Developers need to
          be aware that there might be privacy laws in their jurisdictions that
          can govern the usage and access to user's location data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipients ought to only request position information when necessary,
          and only use the location information for the task for which it was
          provided to them. Recipients ought to dispose of location information
          once that task is completed, unless expressly permitted to retain it
          by the user. Recipients need to also take measures to protect this
          information against unauthorized access. If location information is
          stored, users need to be allowed to update and delete this
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The recipient of location information need to refrain from
          retransmitting the location information without the userâs express
          permission. Care needs to be taken when retransmitting and the use of
          encryption is encouraged.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recipients ought to clearly and conspicuously disclose the fact that
          they are collecting location data, the purpose for the collection,
          how long the data is retained, how the data is secured, how the data
          is shared if it is shared, how users can access, update and delete
          the data, and any other choices that users have with respect to the
          data. This disclosure needs to include an explanation of any
          exceptions to the guidelines listed above.

          their location to websites. In other cases, the content hosted at a
          certain URL changes in such a way that the previously granted
          location permissions no longer apply as far as the user is concerned.
          Or the users might simply change their minds.

        <p>
          Predicting or preventing these situations is inherently difficult.
          Mitigation and in-depth defensive measures are an implementation
          responsibility and not prescribed by this specification. However, in
          designing these measures, implementers are advised to enable user
          awareness of location sharing, and to provide easy access to
          interfaces that enable revocation of permissions.

          Someone visiting a foreign city could access a Web application that
          allows users to search or browse through a database of tourist
          attractions. Using the Geolocation API, the Web application has

        <p>
          A group of friends is hiking through the Scottish highlands. Some of
          them write short notes and take pictures at various points throughout
          the journey and store them using a Web application that can work
          offline on their hand-held devices. Whenever they add new content,
          the application automatically tags it with location data from the
          Geolocation API (which, in turn, uses the on-board GPS device). Every
          time they reach a town or a village, and they are again within
          network coverage, the application automatically uploads their notes
          and pictures to a popular blogging website, which uses the
          geolocation data to construct links that point to a mapping service.
          Users who follow the group's trip can click on these links to see a
          satellite view of the area where the notes were written and the
          pictures were taken. Another example is a life blog where a user
          creates content (e.g. images, video, audio) that records her every
          day experiences. This content can be automatically annotated with
          information such as time, geographic position or even the user's
          emotional state at the time of the recording.

          A user finds themselves in an unfamiliar city area. They want to
          check their position so they use their device to navigate to a
          mapping application that can pinpoint their location on the city map
          using the Geolocation API. The user then asks the Web application to
          provide driving directions from their current position to a different
          destination.

          Turn-by-turn route navigation

        <p>
          A mapping application can help the user navigate along a route by
          providing detailed turn-by-turn directions. The application does this
          by registering with the Geolocation API to receive repeated location
          updates of the user's position. These updates are delivered as soon
          as the implementing user agent determines that the position of the
          user has changed, which allows the application to anticipate any
          changes of direction that the user might need to do.

          A widget-like Web application that shows the weather or news that are
          relevant to the user's current area can use the Geolocation API to
          register for location updates. If the user's position changes, the

          A social network application allows its users to automatically tag
          their status updates with location information. It does this by
          monitoring the user's position with the Geolocation API. Each user
          can control the granularity of the location information (e.g. city or
          neighborhood level) that is shared with the other users. Any user can
          also track their network of friends and get real-time updates about
          their current location.
